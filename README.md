# Todo - Demo App

App, to help demonstrate the power of angular js in helping to create clean front-end applications.

To aid in learning, I've tried to break the iterative process into various tags.  For those unfamiliar with how to use tags, typing:

git checkout tag

Will provide you the code bundled for that particular tag.
