### Version Tags
To aid in learning, I've tried to break the iterative process into various tags.  For those unfamiliar with how to use tags, typing:

* v0.1 - This just illustrates the basic structure of the application and sets up our html to be ready for angular inclusion.
* v0.2 - Code here demonstrates the two-way binding provided to us by angular to hook up our standard 'Hello World' programs.
